   This is released under the Do Whatever The Heck You Want With It license, the terms and agreements being:
	Do whatever the heck you want with it.

   Honestly, this was simple enough to write I really don't care.
   Useful to see if your terminal screen is big enough for, e.g., an asciigame. Currently implemented in j-rogue112.
